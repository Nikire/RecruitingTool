### Ideas

- [ ] Add Company model to keep track of the companies that are using the app (Add router to create these too)
- [ ] Add properties to the User model to keep track the HR user

### To do

- [ ] Add pagination on array responses ( e.g. GET /users )
- [ ] Have a response Interceptor so that all responses are formatted in a standard way
- [ ] Add Profile model and relation between the user
- [ ] Add user Profile update endpoints
- [ ] Add try catch error as a formatedErrorResponse function on every controller return

### Done

- [x] Add SUPER_ADMIN user through script
- [x] Research a better way to document the backend using Swagger
- [x] Add HiringProcess Model to keep track of the hiring process of a company
- [x] Add Stages CRUD and include stages on HiringProcess services
